Interested in extracting wildfire boundaries using Google Earth Engine? Check out this [code.](https://code.earthengine.google.com/e9b1dab5b2339a291ab64ccc7da5bf2b)

AppEEARS (in progress)
This tutorial [tutorial](https://github.com/mariejohnson/wildfire/blob/master/LST/ECOSTRESS_LST.ipynb) uses the wildfire boundaries extracted from the Google Earth Engine code (above) and uses the AppEEARS API to get ECOSTRESS Land Surface Temperature. 

During my time as a Data Science Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) I helped out with the State of Alaskan Salmon and People [project](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/workinggroups/state-alaskan-salmon-and-people-sasap) This [notebook](https://github.com/mariejohnson/spatial_analysis/blob/master/fish_passage.ipynb) looks at impacts to fish passage in Alaska.

Glacial Lake Watershed Analysis with RGEE
This [code](https://github.com/mariejohnson/portfolio/blob/master/watershedAnalysis/code/watershedGPP.R) uses the R's API Google Earth Engine interface to extract Gross Primary Production (GPP) from several watersheds in northwestern Montana. This code was developed to help a fellow labmate that researches glacial lake formation. Notebook coming soon!
